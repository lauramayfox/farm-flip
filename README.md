# Farm Flip 

## Portfolio Project 2 - Javascript Essentials

I have created a farm animal themed card flip memory game geared towards a younger target audience, but suitable for
all ages. I hope to provide a fun, colourful and interactive gaming experience!

## Design Elements

The colour scheme was inspired from a previous personal design project I had worked on in the past, updated with additional colours and elements to suit it to the game concept. When brainstorming ideas for the game site, I knew instantly that I wanted to incorporate one of my graphic cartoons into the game to bring it to life in a real-life web game setting.<br>
The core concept of farm animals was decided upon after choosing my logo from my Graphic Design portfolio, and the name 'Farm Flip' came to me in a short brainstorming session with pen and paper writing out words that rhyme with farm animals and card games.

## Wireframes

In the planning stages, I used Adobe illustrator to play around with the elements before starting the project. I had an initial idea in my head to layout the elements side-by-side, as pictured below. Once I got to the styling elements of the design, I realised this would not be the ideal layout with user-experience in mind as it's not fluid and there's no visual hierarchy.

I went back to my artboard and decided that stacking them centred in block formation was more appealing to the eye, and this was the visual idea I came up with that I went into the project with.

## Research

I searched for similar card style games on both my app store and online for card-based memory style games for inspiration. I also watched several YouTube tutorials to see what ideas I liked from various elements applied to their game projects, and how I might incorporate them into mine. Geeks For Geeks is a great platform for walk throughs on building a memory game, so i read through some of their resources in my research phase.

## Logo 

The logo was inpired by a previous design I did for a fictitius chicken restaurant, and i changed the lettering for this gaming project. The logo in turn inspired the entire theme of the game.

## Game Grid & Cards
The gaming grid consists of 4x3, 12 cards in total. This number of cards was chosen to keep the game at an adequate pace, especially for younger players, and to also work well on smaller screen sizes. The colour orange was chosen to compliment the chicken logo colours and background,while the white outline was chosen to compliment the white background of the main logo character.

## Game Characters
I chose the gaming characters based off the farm theme concept, and found a suitable character set to fit the game style. I wanted the imagery to have a similarity to the types of farming animals you would find in a children's book.
