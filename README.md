# Features

## Design Elements

The colour scheme was inspired from a previous personal design project I had worked on in the past, updated with additional colours and elements to suit it to the game. When brainstorming ideas for the game site, I knew instantly that I wanted to incorporate one of my graphic cartoons into the game to bring it to life in a real-life web game setting. The farm theme is meant to be fun and visually appealing to the player.

## Wireframes

In the planning stages, I used Adobe illustrator to play around with the elements before starting the project. I had an initial idea in my head to layout the elements side-by-side, as pictured below. Once I got to the styling elements of the design, I realised this would not be the ideal layout with user-experience in mind as it's not fluid and there's no visual hierarchy.

I went back to my artboard and decided that stacking them centred in block formation was more appealing to the eye, and this was the visual idea I came up with that I went into the project with.

## Research

I searched for similar games on my app store for card-based memory style games for inspiration. I also watched several YouTube tutorials to see what ideas I liked from various elements applied to their game projects.

# Features Left To Implement

<ul>
<li>In the future I would like to split the gallery into another page where reader's own submissions can be posted and keep a separate archive gallery for the older pictures that can be found online.</li>
<li>Another page idea would be to create an entire timeline, with dates, facts and pictures throughout the years.</li>
<li>A FAQ section to answer the questions that are likely going to be asked through the contact form</li>
<li>An online store which will feature merchandise and art relating to the old hotel, potentially in collaboration with local artists.</li>
</ul>

# Bugs/Errors
