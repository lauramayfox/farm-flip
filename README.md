## Design Elements

The colour scheme was inspired from a previous personal design project I had worked on in the past, updated with additional colours and elements to suit it to the game. When brainstorming ideas for the game site, I knew instantly that I wanted to incorporate one of my graphic cartoons into the game to bring it to life in a real-life web game setting. The farm theme is meant to be fun and visually appealing to the player.

## Wireframes

In the planning stages, I used Adobe illustrator to play around with the elements before starting the project. I had an initial idea in my head to layout the elements side-by-side, as pictured below. Once I got to the styling elements of the design, I realised this would not be the ideal layout with user-experience in mind as it's not fluid and there's no visual hierarchy.

I went back to my artboard and decided that stacking them centred in block formation was more appealing to the eye, and this was the visual idea I came up with that I went into the project with.

## Research

I searched for similar games on my app store for card-based memory style games for inspiration. I also watched several YouTube tutorials to see what ideas I liked from various elements applied to their game projects.
